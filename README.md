# Goal of the Project
Create a social media platform, with a full backed in AWS, that is designed to be an outfit sharing application, powered by AI. This would allow users to earn affiliate income on outfits they post and AI to suggest similar outfits, at possibly cheaper prices, to users, when they want to see similar outfits for a particular clothing item.

To get a more thorough run-down of the project, you may navigate to [my website](https://loganroe.com/) where the final presentation, final design document, final poster, and final **demo video** are present under "Projects -> School Projects -> Senior Design - dripdrop".

# Notes
Despite being given a full school year, in a sense, we spent a large portion of the first semester completing documentation required for the class. The majority of the code was produced in the second semester.
